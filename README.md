Upgrad IITB Lending Club Case Study: Shristi Bisht, Mandavalli NV Saisandeep


## Objective

The primary objective is to identify factors that contribute to loan defaults and to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the likelihood of a loan defaulting. This analysis aims to assist in risk assessment and decision-making processes using data cleaning, univariate and bivariate analysis. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study is sourced from Lending Club. It includes information on borrowers, loan details, and loan performance. The dataset comprises various features such as:

- Borrower information: credit score, annual income, employment length, etc.
- Loan details: loan amount, interest rate, loan grade, etc.
- Loan performance: current status, payment history, etc.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase involves:

- Data cleaning: Handling missing values and duplicates.
- Data visualization: Creating plots to understand distributions and relationships.
- Statistical analysis: Identifying correlations and patterns.

## Conclusion

1. Major Line Ups for Charged Off Loans:
2. Loans assigned lower grades (e.g., D, E, F, G) and subgrades are more likely to be charged off. These grades indicate higher credit risk, correlating with increased default rates. 
3. Borrowers with shorter employment histories are at a higher risk of loan charge-offs. 
4. Renters are more likely to have loans charged off compared to homeowners. Homeownership may reflect financial stability, reducing default risk.
5. Loans taken for debt consolidation purposes have a higher likelihood of being charged off.
